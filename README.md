# 📈 Stock & Options Trading Simulator  
### 🚀 Built for Hackathon 2025  

Welcome to our **Stock & Options Trading Simulator**, a web-based project designed to make learning about the markets both **educational and engaging** — especially for younger, first-time investors.  

Built during Hackathon 2025, this project aims to provide a **risk-free environment** to explore the stock market and gain hands-on experience with **options trading**, all while demystifying key financial concepts.
